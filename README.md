# csci2050u_demos
This is where the demo code (assembly language) for CSCI 2050u will be posted.

1. Hello World, using syscall (OS-specific functionality)
2. Hello World, using libc (theoretically, OS-independent)
3. Input a number, do arithmetic, output result
4. Input a number, determine if it is even or odd
5. Input a number, n, calculate the nth fibonacci number
6. Input a string, string, and convert it to uppercase (relevant to Assignment 2)
7. Version of above, that uses gets() (not recommended in practice, vulnerable to stack overflow)
